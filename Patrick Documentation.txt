Needs from Partner;


28/11/17: 1603;
Goals: I want to get the most recent version of the source methods on github,
I want to write a method to print all running timers,
I want to write a method to print a specific timer,
I want to re-write the second thread to take feed back at the end of each timer;

I have had issues moving source code over like this before I'm not sure if it will be an issue again,
I think I might have to completly rewrite the second thread which will take a while, 
It might actually just be faster to re write the entire program, it very well mgiht need on at some point soon,

Mostly I would like Grace to start working on implimenting the methods into the GUI, as most do work right now;

28/11/17: 1614;
Update: This neededs to be re-writen, I will talk to Grace on how I am going to do this, 
I am not doing it on my surface;

28/11/17: 2020;
Time Spent Working: 3.5 hours;
Accomplished: new out line and severall hundred lines of boiler plate code done;
Blocks found: time needed;
Goals for next day: Finish Rewrite;
Needs from Grace: none;


29/11/17: 1530;
Goals: finish re-write, start meshing with GUI;

29/11/17: 1740;
Update: there is a button that automaticall multi threads something in the GUI, I wrote a method to use this, it is done,
I am going to add events next, then if there is time I will add the old multi-thread code, I think if we want to pause timers we will still need it;

29/11/17: 1845;
Time Spent Working: 3 hours;
Accomplished: Re-write finished,
I added the event Node and Node control, they work, but they are ruff,
They need some refinment, I will do this tomorrow morning before class, but they are more then enough to play with,
I didnot write the other multi-thread method yet, I have a math quiz to study for,
We will see how far you get tonight and go from there tomorrow morning;

30/11/17: 0610;
Goals: Add in orginal multi-tread method before class,
Start meshing GUI;
Expected Challenges: Not a bloody clue, 
The GUI might throw me for a little bit;
Needs for Grace: just keep working, if you could also add the mock up and market resarch links to the ReadME file;

1/12/17: 0003;
Hours Spent working: 6;
Accomplished: I have a working GUI for Adding, Editing, Removing paths,
It will not be a challenge to add events to these Medications, nor do I think it will timers,
The one thing to yet work is the repetive call back asking for user confirmation;
Goals for next day: get events and timers to work, start Dev and call back;
Needs from Grace: Mock-up link;

1/12/17: 0610;
Goals for the Day: To add the Event pages and make them work,
This might be a chalenge, I'm not sure how a background thread button works,
we will see, Linking a medication to an event should be very easy,
again based on how a button that calls a background thread works making the call back feture will be easy or it will be hard;
Needs from Grace: Mock-Up link;

1/12/17
Hours spent working: 2.5;
Accompished: I started writing the code for the events system,
I also fixed two bugs in the medication nodes, one with the search system,
And one with the toString;
Goals for Next Day: I need to get the events working at the call back work,
Expected Challenges: Family are coming over both days this weekend, I'm not sure how long I will be able to work;
Needs for Grace: I mentioned this is a text, it is quite hard to read the current medication queues.

2-3/12/17
Goals: Finish adding events and get call back working;
Hours Spent Working: 4;
Accomplished: All of the code for the events is writen and simply need to add them to the GUI;
Blocks: I was short on time thats all;
Needs from Grace: Non currently;

4/12/17: 0610;
Goals: I want to get the events working;
Expected challenges: null;
Needs form Grace: null;

4/12/17: 19:30;
Hours spent working 3;
Accomplished: On the surface nothing, but I figure a lot out,
The background work does not funtion the way I though,
This requires a thoughs shift;
Goals for Tomorrow: Get Events Working;
Needs Form Grace: Null;

5/12/17: 0610;
Goals: Get Events Working;
Expected Blocks: None;
Needs from Grace: Once I get the Add Events working, if you could do the Edit and Remove events that would be great;

5/12/17: 18:30;
Time Spent Working: 3 hours;
Accomplished: Events can be add, 
bad data is ignored,
events send pop up to screen;
Goals for tomorrow: Get edit and remove events working,
mesh main screen,
make event pages look nice,
add repetative call back to events;
