Needs from Partner;


28/11/17: 1603;
Goals: I want to get the most recent version of the source methods on github,
I want to write a method to print all running timers,
I want to write a method to print a specific timer,
I want to re-write the second thread to take feed back at the end of each timer;

I have had issues moving source code over like this before I'm not sure if it will be an issue again,
I think I might have to completly rewrite the second thread which will take a while, 
It might actually just be faster to re write the entire program, it very well mgiht need on at some point soon,

Mostly I would like Grace to start working on implimenting the methods into the GUI, as most do work right now;

28/11/17: 1614;
Update: This neededs to be re-writen, I will talk to Grace on how I am going to do this, 
I am not doing it on my surface;

28/11/17: 2020;
Time Spent Working: 3.5 hours;
Accomplished: new out line and severall hundred lines of boiler plate code done;
Blocks found: time needed;
Goals for next day: Finish Rewrite;
Needs from Grace: none;


29/11/17: 1530;
Goals: finish re-write, start meshing with GUI;

29/11/17: 1740;
Update: there is a button that automaticall multi threads something in the GUI, I wrote a method to use this, it is done,
I am going to add events next, then if there is time I will add the old multi-thread code, I think if we want to pause timers we will still need it;

29/11/17: 1845;
Time Spent Working: 3 hours;
Accomplished: Re-write finished,
I added the event Node and Node control, they work, but they are ruff,
They need some refinment, I will do this tomorrow morning before class, but they are more then enough to play with,
I didnot write the other multi-thread method yet, I have a math quiz to study for,
We will see how far you get tonight and go from there tomorrow morning;

30/11/17: 0610;
Goals: Add in orginal multi-tread method before class,
Start meshing GUI;
Expected Challenges: Not a bloody clue, 
The GUI might throw me for a little bit;
Needs for Grace: just keep working, if you could also add the mock up and market resarch links to the ReadME file;
