Goals: I want to get the most recent version of the source methods on github,
I want to write a method to print all running timers,
I want to write a method to print a specific timer,
I want to re-write the second thread to take feed back at the end of each timer;

I have had issues moving source code over like this before I'm not sure if it will be an issue again,
I think I might have to completly rewrite the second thread which will take a while, 
It might actually just be faster to re write the entire program, it very well mgiht need on at some point soon,

Mostly I would like Grace to start working on implimenting the methods into the GUI, as most do work right now;

Update: This neededs to be re-writen, I will talk to Grace on how I am going to do this, 
I am not doing it on my surface;
